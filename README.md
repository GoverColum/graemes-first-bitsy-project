# Apocalypse Now: Mango Hunt

A short Bitsy game adapted from a single scene from Apocalypse Now.

##About

This game is based on the scene from the movie (from 53:14 to about 58:00) in which Captain Willard is accompanying Chef on an ill-advised search for mangos in the Vietnamese jungles in the middle of a war. The two of them do not find any mangos and are chased out by a tiger. My goal is to capture the essence of this one scene in a Bitsy game.

##Design Notes and Ideas

I'm thinking the avatar will represent two very simple armed figures facing opposite directions, perhaps one taller than the other. There will be one scene of the boat and at least two of the jungle, and I will attempt to use a very cool and dark color palette reminiscent of the scene from the movie. The player will be given the goal of collecting mangos, which is done by interacting with tree sprites that each reveal in text whether or not they have any (none of them will). Interacting with one tree in the final scene will trigger the appearance of a tiger sprite, which will either move toward the player or just stay still with a text box telling the player to run. When the player makes it back to the boat, the level will end with the words "never get out of the boat" appearing in a text box. These are the ideas I have so far, and I'm hoping to come up with more over time.
